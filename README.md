Imports from a Spotify account to rd.io
=======================================

Note that this only works with Spotify's default playlist naming scheme of ARTIST - ALBUM.

Instructions
------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Run bundle install
3. Copy credentials_sample.rb to credentials.rb
4. Get a libspotify appkey and place it in the same directory - get the binary version
5. Run ruby import.rb
